**Ackleys Function**

---

In mathematical optimization, the Ackley function is a non-convex function used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. It was proposed by David Ackley in his 1987 PhD Dissertation.

\begin{equation}
f(x_1,x_2) = -20exp{([0.2\sqrt{0.5(x_1^2 + x_2^2)}])}  - exp{([0.5(\cos{2\pi x_1} + \cos{2\pi x_2})])} + e +20
\end{equation}
